# sunshine-live-pls-maker

usage: 
```
$ bash ssl.sh > ssl.pls  
```
Im shure there are better ways (like not saving stuff to a file an delet it after all) ... tbh used this to kill some time and thought i could share this if anyone is interested in getting all sunshin live streams in one file automated.
